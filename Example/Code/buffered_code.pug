//-
  Pug allows you to write inline JavaScript code in your templates.
  There are three types of code:
  Unbuffered,
  Buffered, and
  Unescaped Buffered.

//-
  Buffered code starts with =. It evaluates the JavaScript expression and
  outputs the result. For security, buffered code is first HTML escaped.
  p
    = 'This code is <escaped>!'

//-
  <p>This code is &lt;escaped&gt;!</p>
